# My First JavaScript Library

This is a simple JavaScript library that I created as part of a course. It provides a set of utility functions for common tasks and can be easily integrated into your JavaScript projects.

## Installation

To use the library, you can either download the `library.js` file from this repository or include it directly from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Once the library is included in your project, you can start using its functions. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Call a function from the library
library.doSomething();

// Use another function
const result = library.calculateSomething(5, 10);
console.log(result);
```

Refer to the library documentation for a complete list of available functions and their usage.

## Contributing

Contributions to this library are not currently accepted as it was created for learning purposes. However, feel free to use it in your projects and provide feedback.

Enjoy using my first JavaScript library! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me.
